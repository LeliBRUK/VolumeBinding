By default, the knob comes on majority of keyboard in which contains ones, only affects the overall system volume.   
not necessarily bad, but can be a bit annoying  when you want to only affect the volume of an specific application.   


The purpose of the script is to allow the knob to such a thing. By default, when running the script, knob no longer controls the overall system, as great majority of headsets or headphones nowadays already does a similar action.   

it instead turns volume up by 10% when rotating the knob clockwise - â†©ðŸ”Š   

and turns volume down by 10% when rotating the knob anticlockwise - â†ªðŸ”Š   


as in for other applications, you will need to use a combination of input   

Brave - B+ðŸ”Š    accordantly   

Discord - D+ðŸ”Š  accordantly    



This script uses of a tool made by [NirSoft](https://www.nirsoft.net/) called [SoundVolumeViewe](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/sound_volume_view.html).   
[Volume Controller](https://github.com/LeliBRUK/VolumeBinding/releases) Takes advantage of its command-line and rebinds certain inputs from user to control volume of specific applications without the need to focus on its windows.   
The application was done and compiled by using [AHK](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
